''' Bucket sort is useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range
Assumptions:
 - Uniform distribution over a range

Algorithm:
 - Create N buckets of equal size covering the input range
 - For each input, add it to the corresponding bucket
 - Sort individual buckets
 - Append output with data of each bucket

Complexity: O(n)

Input: [4, 5, 9, 1, 3]
